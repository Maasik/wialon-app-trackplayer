<p>  Track Player allows to draw movements of units on the map and then play them. It is possible to view how a unit was moving and how its various parameters were changing with time.
  Tracks can be drawn and played for several units at once (for the same time interval only). A different color can be applied to each track to distinguish them on the map. 
  At the bottom, there is a time line where you see playback progress, navigate along the tracks, control playback speed, etc. 
  While a track is played, different kinds of data dynamically update on the screen. That can be speed, sensor values, parameters, pictures from messages, etc. </p>
